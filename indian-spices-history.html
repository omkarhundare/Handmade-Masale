        <hr>

        <div class="container mb-5">

            <p>Indian spices have an ancient history of many years. Cloves are mentioned in ancient Indian epics like
                the Ramayana.</p>
            <p>To trade spices around the East African coast, Indonesian traders went to China, India, and Middle East.
                Arab traders facilitated easy routes between the Middle East and India. The Egyptian city of Alexandria
                became a major spice center because of its port facility.
            </p>
            <p>With the arrival of spices from eastern spice producers to Western European consumers, the trade route
                of spices gradually changed from the land route to the sea route. European traders facilitated spice
                trade through the sea. It is no wonder that India has attracted the attention of the whole world due to
                its abundance of herbs and spices. From the Assyrians and Babylonians to the Arabs, Romans, Egyptians,
                Chinese, British and Portuguese, they invaded India with a single goal: to benefit from the abundant
                natural resources and the origins of spices.</p>
            <p>The first written records of Indian spices are found in the Rigveda (circa 6000 B. C.) and the Yajurveda,
                Samaveda and Atharvaveda. During the Vedik period, information was mainly passed on through verbal
                messages. Rigveda mentions many spices and Yajurveda also mentions black cumin.</p>
            <p>Spices from China, Indonesia, India, and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) were carried on the backs of donkeys
                and camels from one place to another. Arabs dominated the spice trade for about 5000 years until
                Europeans discovered the sea route to India.</p>
            <p>Many sea voyages were made to discover a more beneficial method of acquiring spices. Ferdinand
                Magellan, Vasco da Gama and Christopher Columbus were one of them. After traveling through Africa in
                1497 Ancient explorer Vasco da Gama discovered Kozhikode in 1498 on the southwest coast of India. He
                returned with nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, ginger and pepper. After he arrived on India's Malabar coast, a
                center of the spice trade, direct trade began with Europe and South-west Asia.</p>
            <p>Most ancient spices cinnamon and black pepper became the basis of numerous trade relations with the
                Arabs and Romans - and eventually, among other valuable goods - with the Arabs. By year 1300, a
                pound of nutmeg was worth more than gold in Europe. Within a short time the Portuguese had seized
                control of the spice trade areas of the Persian Gulf, and established a near-monopoly on the Indian
                spice
                trade that was long overdue and extremely profitable for the Portuguese empire</p>
            <p>In the past, only black pepper and salt were used for flavoring in the western countries. In the early
                days, the communication facility was insignificant, so very little quantity of Spices could be traded.
            </p>
            <p>Therefore the Arab traders from the west tried to increase communication on a large scale by
                establishing the Silk Road. But it did not make much of a difference to the spice trade.
            </p>
            <p>Silk road was the main route used for world trade in ancient times. This road was built along the banks
                of the Nile River. The reason for this was that the travelers and their accompanying camels and other
                animals should have adequate water facilities during the journey. At that time, camels and other
                animals were used to transport spices, and trading of Spices wasn't done as expected. During this
                period, that road became so famous, that robbers started robbing the traders from time to time, and
                later, the Ottoman Empire, Abdul Farak Empire, the Far Empire, and the Muslim Empire also started
                levying taxes. Therefore, the number of spices increased greatly, and use of spices became more
                common among rich people.
            </p>
            <p>In order to increase the spice trade communication on a large scale, the Portuguese and Spanish traders
                searched for sea routes for communication. At that time these routes were called Vasco de Gama route
                and Columbus route. Due to these sea routes, faster spice trade, affordable prices, large quantity of
                spices began to be exported, so spices started reaching the homes of common people at affordable
                prices and the wonderful aroma of spices started to spread in the common families including the
                families of rich people.</p>
            <p>Later the Portuguese captured Goa and built a port in the sea for exports and started exporting Spices
                from India to all over the world on a big scale. But traders from some countries were not ready to do
                business with the Portuguese, so the Portuguese imposed rules for the export trade in year 1510 to
                1511 and started exporting Spices. Then they built Malakachi and Mortugil ports in Malay peninsula for
                the trade of spices and made arrangements with traders from China and Siam territory to improve trade
                in other countries.</p>
            <p>In the same period traders from United Kingdom and Europe came to know from the Arab people about
                Spices so they began gathering more information about them. They realised that Seeds, fruits, roots,
                bark, flowers and other plants are grown on a large scale in India and they are used to add taste and
                colour to the vegetables. So they wanted to search for a faster sea route to import Spices from United
                Kingdom and Europe from India and the Portuguese began to export Spices from United Kingdom and
                Europe to all over the world.</p>
            <p>After the Portuguese, the British did the trading of Spices from India up to year 1600 for which the
                British were paying taxes to the Portuguese. Later India became independent and the number of Indian
                traders began to increase. As manufacturers and traders of Spices, we take pride in the fact that from
                then until now, India has the largest share of 75% of manufacturing and exporting of Spices in the
                world.</p>
            <p>
                Indian Spices have become means of economic and personal development.</p>
            <p>Indian Spices have medicinal properties and that's why they are good for health. That's why they are
                considered good for digestion and necessary for various food recipes around the world. Some of the
                Spices have Anti-oxident properties and some have protective properties and they are used in Pickles
                and Chutneys.</p>
