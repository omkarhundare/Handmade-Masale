        <hr>

        <div class="container mb-5">

        <p>Pickles are an integral part of Indian food culture. Pickles have been made in India since ancient times.
            Also, according to the season of fruits and vegetables at that time, and by using the ingredients and
            other spices and oils in proper proportion, pickles were made which lasted throughout the year.
            Irrespective of the food tradition of any state, pickles are included in it. Even if there are many dishes
            in
            the plate, the taste of the food changes with a single pickle.</p>
        <p>Pickle is called 'Pickle' in English language. The word and substance came into existence in Western
            countries in the fourteenth century. Vegetables and fruits were used to make it. Although it is true that
            as times changed, so has our food culture, it is equally true that pickles are still an important part of
            our
            food culture.</p>
        <p>Pickles not only enhance the taste of food, but also provides nutrients to our body. From mango, lemon,
            amla to radish, carrot, flower, bitter gourd, any fruits or vegetables can be pickled. Some pickles are
            short-lived, while others last well throughout the year</p>
        <p>As early as 2030 BC, Mesopotamia residents are mentioned in many ancient historical accounts as eating
            pickled cucumbers. It is said that at that time the people of North India took cucumber seeds to the
            Tigris Valley and thus cucumber cultivation started there.
        </p>
        <p>The method of making pickles is mentioned in ancient Ayurveda and this method has a history of
            thousands of years. Pickle is used as a digestive and laxative. Moravala and Chyavanprash are also a type
            of medicinal pickle and are beneficial for health. The saliva that is released in the mouth after eating
            pickles helps in digestion.</p>
        <p>Egyptian beauty Cleopatra was very fond of pickled cucumber, and famous philosopher Aristotle also
            described pickled cucumber and its health benefits in his writings. Throughout Asia, pickles are included
            in the food culture of almost every country, and region. In Korea, pickles have a history of three
            thousand years. The tradition of pickles in Korea came from China. Although the tradition is Chinese,
            Koreans have adapted it and modified it to suit their food culture.</p>
        <p>In the 16th century Europe also began to preserve many foods by processing them. As a result tomato
            ketchup, various jams, jellies and marmalades came into existence. Vegetables and fruits were also
            pickled. Whether pickle is part of everyday meals, or made with vegetable or fruit made for a special
            occasion, there is no doubt that this dish is everyone's favorite and a food enhancer.
        </p>
        <p>As our country India is an agricultural nation, many types of fruits, flowers, tubers and vegetables are
            available in abundance in our country, which greatly benefits the fruit processing industry export trade
            system of our country. The name of the person who invented pickles is not mentioned anywhere, but
            history mentions that the invention of pickles originated in the Tigris of the earlier United India.</p>
        <p>Pickled cucumbers were made and after that the same process was used to preserve many such fruits
            and vegetables for a longer period of time. Since then, pickles have been widely used by world traders
            traveling along the Silk Road and by sea, and used in many wars.
        </p>
        <p>Pickles are called by different names in different countries.
        </p>
        <p>1) India – Achaar, 2) South Korea – Kimchi, 3) Germany – Sourkrant, 4) Finland – Herring, 5) Morocco –
            Lahmad Makid, 6) Japan – Kiyari Zuke, 7) Israel – Taurashi, 8) Sweden – Pickled Herring, 9) France –
            corny corn
        </p>
        <p>Traditional and handmade pickles taste good and contain many minerals. It is useful when traveling, as it
            contains natural preservatives that aid in digestion. Pickles are an excellent source of vitamin K and E
            which helps in boosting immunity, helps in regulating blood pressure and heart rate. As it also contains
            iron, copper and calcium, the Jewish community recognized the importance of this substance and
            traded pickles on a very large scale throughout the world.
        </p>
        <p>The Lingapurana, a Kannada text dated 1594 BC, describes 50 types of pickles. Pickles are mentioned in
            Manosola, Supashastra, Pakdarpan and scriptures. Pickles are mentioned in the Bible and other Western
            texts.</p>
        <p>Most importantly, pickling is mentioned extensively in the history of the Marathas during the third
            battle of Panipat in Haryana. At that time, first of all, during the war, each other's grain stocks were
            destroyed. A few Marathas survived after the Battle of Panipat as they had to fight half-fed and are still
            known in Panipat as Gujjar Marathas. From then till today Gujjar Maratha community in Panipat started
            pickle business for livelihood. Mainly five-color pickle, seven-color pickle, Kairi (mango) pickle, chili
            pickle and lemon pickle were popular among them.
        </p>

            business of exporting pickles from India to the world has grown tremendously.</p>
